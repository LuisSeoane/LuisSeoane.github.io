🚧 Under Construction
======
Thanks for visiting! I’m currently building this site as I prepare for the job market.

In the meantime, here’s a bit about me:
Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Connecticut, with research interests in Health Economics, Labor Economics, and Industrial Organization.

🧐 By day: Applied Economist.
By night: Still an economist (Google Scholar can confirm).
Exploring health, labor, and IO—one dataset at a time.

More updates coming soon!
