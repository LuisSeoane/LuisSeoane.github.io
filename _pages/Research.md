Suboptimal breastfeeding in the U.S. carries substantial health and economic costs and is marked by persistent disparities. The 2022 formula shortage coincided with disruptions in infant feeding practices. This study documents changes in breastfeeding during the shortage period and projects associated infant illness and healthcare costs. Using 2017–2022 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data, we applied Bayesian structural time-series models to estimate deviations in breastfeeding initiation and duration during the shortage period relative to prior trends. We then used Monte Carlo simulation to project infant illness and healthcare costs. During the 2022 formula shortage, breastfeeding for at least four months was higher by 3.43 percentage points (95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.11, 5.74). Breastfeeding at one, two, and three months postpartum was 2.49 to 3.55% age points higher, and initiation was higher by 1.54 percentage points (95% CrI: 0.46, 2.59). Estimates varied across sociodemographic groups and were larger among less advantaged mothers, corresponding with smaller observed breastfeeding disparities. The simulation projects annual healthcare costs approximately $420 million lower. During the formula shortage groups with historically lower breastfeeding rates exhibited higher breastfeeding levels, highlighting the relevance of breastfeeding trends for discussions of infant disease and healthcare costs.

  This study estimates the economic impact of Connecticut’s aquaculture sector using input–output modeling. In 2022, the industry generated $33.5 million in output and supported 482 jobs. The analysis tracks trends from 2016 to 2023, with a focus on shellfish production and its economic effects. By combining administrative sales data with federal survey information, applying sector mapping, and converting results into constant dollars for trend analysis, the study illustrates best practices in economic impact analysis. These practices strengthen transparency and enhance the policy relevance of regional aquaculture studies

Breastfeeding provides substantial health benefits for both children and mothers; yet the U.S. rates remain suboptimal, with disparities shaped by structural, social, and policy factors. This study examines how the U.S. hospital maternity care practices influence breastfeeding initiation, with particular attention to their impact across different population groups. We analyzed cross-sectional county-level variations in hospital maternity care quality and breastfeeding initiation from 2017 to 2022 using data from the National Vital Statistics System and the Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) surveys. We employed a linear probability model to assess these relationships. Higher county mPINC scores are significantly associated with increased breastfeeding initiation, with each additional point linked to a 0.10 percentage point (pp) increase (p < 0.001). This association varies by race/ethnicity. Each additional mPINC point corresponds to a 0.25 pp increase for non-Hispanic Black mothers (p < 0.001) and a 0.14 pp increase for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native mothers (p < 0.001), approximately three and two times higher, respectively, than the increase for non-Hispanic White mothers. The effect of better maternity practices also differs by county type, with a 0.08 pp increase in metro areas (p < 0.001) and a 0.17 pp increase in nonmetro areas (p < 0.001). Higher quality hospital maternity care practices are associated with increased breastfeeding initiation, particularly among population groups with historically lower breastfeeding rates. Enhancing maternity care policies and practices may help reduce long-standing breastfeeding disparities.

Breastfeeding enhances maternal and child health, yet US breastfeeding rates remain below optimal levels and substantial disparities persist. The 2022 infant formula crisis had the potential to influence infant feeding practices due to formula shortages and fears about the safety of formula feeding in the wake of recalls. This report studies the evolution of breastfeeding-initiation trends during the infant formula crisis and compares the effects across subpopulations. This study analyzed 2016–2022 national birth certificate data from 47 states and the District of Columbia based on Bayesian structural time-series analysis to measure average changes in breastfeeding-initiation trends and a linear probability model to test for heterogeneous effects. During the 2022 infant formula crisis, average breastfeeding-initiation rates increased by 1.96 percentage points (pp) (95% credible interval, 1.68 pp to 2.23 pp) and remained elevated above historical levels at the end of the formula crisis. The increase was particularly pronounced among mothers with lower education levels, those receiving Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children assistance, residents of less populated counties, Medicaid recipients, and Black mothers, possibly due to their higher reliance on formula feeding. Populations meeting all of these sociodemographic criteria experienced the largest increase in breastfeeding initiation at 6.06 pp (95% confidence interval, 5.26 pp to 6.87 pp). Preexisting disparities in breastfeeding initiation declined in 2022. The infant formula crisis highlights the potential for addressing breastfeeding disparities and reducing associated child and maternal health risks through targeted interventions to promote breastfeeding.
